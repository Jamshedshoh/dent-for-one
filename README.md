**OBJECTIVE**
Dent App: Lead-generation platform for Dental Clinics

The objective of this proposal is to create and launch an all-in-one marketplace platform integrated with automation tools to streamline online marketing, engagement, and lead generation for dental clinics. Dent in One offers a comprehensive suite of apps that empower clinics to attract, convert, and retain patients more effectively while significantly reducing operational and marketing costs.

The platform includes a Marketplace App, enabling clinics to offer an online shop where patients can purchase dental care products and refer new customers through affiliate links to earn loyalty points. The Social Share App is a smart content automation tool that allows staff to participate in marketing campaigns by sharing clinic-generated content, earning points for each successful referral or engagement. The Care App supports dentists in recommending personalized dental care routines, with features like habit tracking and ongoing follow-ups to improve patient outcomes. Additionally, the Booking App offers seamless appointment scheduling that integrates with existing systems or operates independently, allowing patients to book based on their real-time availability. Together, these tools provide a unified digital ecosystem to modernize dental practices and enhance patient experiences at every touchpoint.
